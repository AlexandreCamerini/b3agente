# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-18)

**Core value:** O usuário leigo sai do Modo Estudo entendendo de verdade como o mercado funciona — não decorou uma resposta, aprendeu o raciocínio — e só então tem acesso a automações do Modo Operador.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 (Realismo de Mercado) — roadmap just approved, ready to plan

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Realismo de Mercado) — first phase of v1.1
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-18 — ROADMAP.md created for v1.1 (Phases 2-5), 34/34 requirements mapped

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v1.1)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap v1.1: severity-based grouping for the 30 FIX-C* corrections
  (Phase 3 = 2 Crítico + 8 Alto together, following REPORT-01's own
  technical-dependency sequencing) instead of pure dimension-based —
  the report's "Sugestão de sequenciamento" already chains C-11→C-30,
  C-12→C-36, C-20→C-19, C-31→C-32, C-35→C-37 by technical prerequisite,
  not by product dimension.

- Roadmap v1.1: the 20 Médio corrections split by cohesion, not severity
  alone — Phase 4 groups STORY+UX (user-facing: pedagogy, disclaimers,
  accessibility), Phase 5 groups CODE+GATE+ADMIN (technical: test
  coverage, gate call-site hygiene, admin observability). All 4 v1.1
  phases marked technically independent (no hard "Depends on" between
  them) — advisor caught an over-claimed Phase 5→Phase 3 dependency
  (C33/C34 touch the same call site as C31/C32 but as an independent
  parameter, not a prerequisite) that would have needlessly serialized
  work given config.json's parallelization:true.

- Phase numbering continues from v1.0 (Phase 1) — v1.1 starts at Phase 2,
  no --reset-phase-numbers used.
